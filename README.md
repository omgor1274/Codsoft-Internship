    <h1>Task : 1</h1>
    <h2><b>TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether apassenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginnerproject with readily available data.</li>
      <li>The dataset typically used for this project contains informationabout individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticketclass, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
    <h1>Task : 2</h1>
    <h2><b>MOVIE RATING PREDICTION</b></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based onfeatures like genre, director, and actors. You can use regressiontechniques to tackle this problem.</li>
      <li>The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a modelthat accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users orcritics.</li>
      <li>Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore dataanalysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machinelearning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factorsthat influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model thatcan estimate the ratings of movies accurately.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <h1>Task : 3</h1>
  <h2><b>IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.</li>
    <li>Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h1>Task : 4</h1>
  <h2><b>SALES PREDICTION</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.</li>
    <li>In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on
the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h1>Task : 5</h1>
  <h2><b>CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.</li>
    <li>Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
    <li>Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.</li>
  </ul>
